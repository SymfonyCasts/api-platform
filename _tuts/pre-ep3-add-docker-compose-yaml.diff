 You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
 on how you installed Composer.
 
-**Configure the .env (or .env.local) File**
+**2) Start the symfony web server**
 
-Open the `.env` file and make any adjustments you need - specifically
-`DATABASE_URL`. Or, if you want, you can create a `.env.local` file
-and *override* any configuration you need there (instead of changing
-`.env` directly).
+You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
+works even better - especially if you're using Docker for
+the database.
 
-**Setup the Database**
+To install the Symfony local web server, follow
+"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
+here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
+once on your system.
 
-Again, make sure `.env` is setup for your computer. Then, create
-the database & tables!
+Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
+project, and run:
 
 ```
-php bin/console doctrine:database:create
-php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
+symfony serve -d
 ```
 
-If you get an error that the database exists, that should
-be ok. But if you have problems, completely drop the
-database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.
+(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an

-This tutorial uses [Webpack Encore](https://symfonycasts.com/encore),
-which isn't important to understand what's going on, but *is* important
-to get our app running. We'll also do a little bit of JavaScript coding
-to talk to our API.
+** 3) Database Setup (with Docker)**
 
-Make sure to install Node and also [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
-Then run:
+The easiest way to set up the database is to use the `docker-compose.yaml`
+file that's included in this project. First, make sure Docker is downloaded
+and running on your machine. Then, from inside the project, run:
 
 ```
-yarn install
-yarn encore dev --watch
+docker-compose up -d
 ```
 
-**Start the built-in web server**
+Congrats! You now have a database running! And as long as you use the
+"symfony binary" web server (described below), the `DATABASE_URL`
+environment variable will automatically be exposed to your web server:
+no need to configure `.env`.
 
-You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
-works even better.
+For more information about this approach, see https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony5-doctrine
 
-To install the Symfony local web server, follow
-"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
-here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
-once on your system.
+** 3 Alternative) Database Setup (without Docker)**
 
-Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
-project, and run:
+If you do not want to use Docker, you can also just install and run
+MySQL manually. When you're done, open the `.env` file and make any
+adjustments you need - specifically `DATABASE_URL`. Or, better,
+you can create a `.env.local` file and *override* any configuration
+you need there (instead of changing `.env` directly).
+
+** 4) Database Schema**
+
+To actually *create* the database and get some tables, run:
 
 ```
-symfony serve
+symfony console doctrine:database:create
+symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
 ```
 
-(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
-error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).
+This uses the `symfony` binary, but `symfony console` is identical
+to `php bin/console`, except that this allows the `DATABASE_URL`
+environment variable to be injected if you're using Docker.
+
+If you get an error that the database exists, that should
+be ok. But if you have problems, completely drop the
+database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.
+
+** 4b) Database Schema for Tests**
 
-Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`
+To execute the tests, you may (if you're using the Docker integration)
+need to also initialize the database inside the test database container:
+
+```
+symfony console doctrine:database:create --env=test
+symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test
+```
+
+** 5) Optional: Compiling Webpack Encore Assets**
+
+This tutorial uses [Webpack Encore](https://symfonycasts.com/encore),
+which isn't important to understand what's going on. The compiled
+assets are already included in the download, so unless you want to
+play around with the JavaScript, you can skip this step.
+
+Make sure to install Node and also [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).
+Then run:
+
+```
+yarn install
+yarn encore dev --watch
+```
