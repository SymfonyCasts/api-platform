# Our First ApiResource

Question: have you ever gone to the store and accidentally bought *too* much
cheese? It's the story of my life. Or maybe you have the opposite problem:
you're hosting a big party and you don't have *enough* cheese! This is our new
billion dollar idea: a platform where you can sell that extra chunk of Brie you
never finished or buy a truck-load of camembert from someone who go a little
too excited at the cheese market. Yep, it's what the world is asking for: a
peer-to-peer cheese marketplace. We're calling it: Cheese Whiz.

For the site, maybe we're going to make it an single-page application built in
React or Vue... or maybe it'll be a little more traditional: a mixture of HTML
pages and JavaScript that makes AJAX requests. And maybe we'll even have a mobile
app. It doesn't really matter because *all* of these options mean that we need
to be able to expose our core functionality via an API.

## Generating the Entity

But to start: *forget* about the API and pretend like this is a normal, boring
Symfony project. Step 1 is... hmm, probably do create some database entities.

Let's open up our `.env` file and tweak the `DATABASE_URL`. My computer uses
`root` with no password... and how about `cheese_whiz` for the database name.

[[[ code('b92d6c0ac7') ]]]

You can also create a `.env.local` file and override `DATABASE_URL` there. Using
`root` and no password is pretty standard, so I like to add this to `.env` and
commit it as the default.

Cool! Next, at your terminal, run

```terminal
composer require maker --dev
```

to get Symfony's MakerBundle... so we can be lazy and generate our entity.
When that finishes, run:

```terminal
php bin/console make:entity
```

Call the first entity: `CheeseListing`, which will represent each "cheese"
that's for sale on the site. Hit enter and... oh! It's asking:

> Mark this class as an API Platform resource?

MakerBundle asks this because it noticed that API Platform is installed. Say
"yes". And before we add *any* fields, let's go see what that did! In my editor,
yep! This created the usual `CheeseListing` and `CheeseListingRepository`.
Nothing special there. Right now, the only property the entity has is `id`. So,
what did answering "yes" to the API Platform resource question give us? This tiny
annotation right here: `@ApiResource`. 

[[[ code('beab5706e8') ]]]

The *real* question is: what does that activate? We'll see that soon.

But first, let's add some fields. Let's see, each cheese listing probably needs
a `title`, `string`, `255`, not nullable, a `description`, which will be a big
text field, `price`, which I'll make an `integer` - this will be the price in
*cents* - so $10 would be 1000, `createdAt` as a `datetime` and an `isPublished`
boolean. Ok: good start! Hit enter to finish.

Congratulations! We have a *perfectly* boring `CheeseEntity` class: 7 properties
with getters and setters.

Next, generate the migration with:

```terminal
php bin/console make:migration
```

Oh! Migrations isn't installed yet! No problem, follow the recommendation:

```terminal
composer require migrations:3.0.3
```

But before we try generating it again, I need to make sure my database exists:

```terminal
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
```

And *now* run `make:migration`:

```terminal-silent
php bin/console make:migration
```

Let's go check that out to make sure there aren't any surprises:

> CREATE TABLE cheese_listing...

[[[ code('aa7c60ad0f') ]]]

Yea! Looks good! Close that and run:

```terminal
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## Say Hello to your API!

Brilliant! At this point, we have a *completely* traditional Doctrine entity
*except* for this one, `@ApiResource()` annotation. But *that* changes everything.
This tells API Platform that you want to *expose* this class as an API.

Check it out: refresh the `/api` page. Woh! Suddenly this is saying that we have
*five* new endpoints, or "operations"! A `GET` operation to retrieve a collection
of CheeseListings, a `POST` operation to create a new one, `GET` to retrieve a single
`CheeseListing`, `DELETE` to... ya know... delete and `PUT` to update an
existing `CheeseListing`. That's a full, API-based CRUD!

And this isn't just documentation: these new endpoints *already* work. Let's
check them out next, say hello to something called JSON-LD and learn a bit about
how this magic works behind the scenes.
