# Bootstrapping a Test Suite

Our security requirements are about to get... pretty complicated. And so, instead
of testing all of that manually and hoping we don't break anything, I think it's
time to take a few minutes to get a nice functional testing system set up.

Spin over to your terminal and run:

```terminal
composer require "test:1.0.6" "symfony/phpunit-bridge:4.3.3" --dev
```

This will download Symfony's test-pack, which most importantly comes with the
PHPUnit bridge: a small Symfony component that wraps around PHPUnit.

When that finishes... yep - we'll put our tests in the `tests/` directory and *run*
PHPUnit via `php bin/phpunit`. That's a bit different than if you installed
PHPUnit directly and you'll see why in a minute. That file -  `bin/phpunit` was
added by the recipe. And... if you run `git status`, you'll see that the recipe
also added a `phpunit.xml.dist` file, which holds sensible default config for
PHPUnit itself.

## Configuring the PHPUnit Version

Open that file up. One of the keys here is called `SYMFONY_PHPUNIT_VERSION`,
which at the time I recorded this is set to 7.5 in the recipe. You can leave
this or change it to the latest version of PHPUnit, which for me is 8.2

***TIP
PHPUnit 8.2 requires PHP 7.2. If you're using PHP 7.1, stay with PHPUnit 7.5.

But wait... why are we controlling the version of PHPUnit via some variable in
an XML file? Isn't PHPUnit a dependency in our `composer.json` file? Actually...
no! When you use Symfony's PHPUnit bridge, you *don't* require PHPUnit directly.
Instead, you tell *it* which version you want, and *it* downloads it in the background.

Check it out. Run:

```terminal
php bin/phpunit
```

This downloads PHPUnit in the background and installs its dependencies.
That's not really an important detail... but it might surprise you the
first time you run this. Where *did* it download PHPUnit? Again, that's not an
important detail... but I *do* like to know what's going on. In your `bin/`
directory, you'll *now* find a `.phpunit/` directory.

## Customizing the test Database

After downloading PHPUnit, that `bin/phpunit` script *does* then execute our tests...
except that we don't have any yet. Before we write our first one, let's tweak
a few other things.

The recipe added another interesting file: `.env.test`. Thanks to its name, this
file will *only* be loaded in the `test` environment... which allows *us* to create
test-specific settings. For example, I like to use a different database for my
tests so that running them doesn't mess with my development database.

[[[ code('ae2f44f22c') ]]]

Inside `.env`, copy the `DATABASE_URL` key, paste it in `.env.test` and add a little
`_test` at the end.

[[[ code('cb72af0955') ]]]

Cool, right? One of the gotchas of the `.env` system is that the `.env.local`
file is *normally* loaded last and allows us to override settings for our local
computer. That happens in *every* environment... except for `test`. In the `test`
environment, `.env` & `.env.test` are read, but *not* `.env.local`. That little
inconsistency exists so that everyone's test environment behaves the same way.

Anyways, now that our test environment knows to use a different database, let's
create that database! Run `bin/console doctrine:database:create`. But since we
want this command to execute in the `test` environment, also add `--env=test`:

```terminal-silent
php bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=test
```

Repeat that same thing with the `doctrine:schema:create` command:

```terminal-silent
php bin/console doctrine:schema:create --env=test
```

Perfect! Next, Api Platform has some *really* nice testing tools which... aren't
released yet. Boo! Well... because I'm impatient, let's backport those new tools
into our app and get our first test running.
